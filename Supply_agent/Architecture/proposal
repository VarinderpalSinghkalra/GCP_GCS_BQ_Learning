Proposal: Enterprise Multi-Agent Conversational System with Governed Execution on Google Cloud

⸻

1. Proposal Objective

This proposal outlines the design, implementation, and justification of an enterprise-grade, multi-agent conversational system built using modern agent frameworks and deployed on Google Cloud.

The objective is to deliver:
	•	A simple conversational user experience
	•	Backed by a robust, governed, and scalable multi-agent architecture
	•	Capable of handling high-risk, high-impact workflows such as supply chain execution and financial approvals

The solution intentionally balances conversational simplicity with architectural rigor.

⸻

2. Business Context & Problem Statement

2.1 Current Challenge

While conversational AI systems are increasingly easy to build, most implementations:
	•	Lack governance
	•	Collapse all logic into a single agent
	•	Allow unsafe direct execution
	•	Are unsuitable for enterprise workflows involving cost, approvals, or compliance

For low-risk domains (e.g., ticket creation), this approach is acceptable.
For enterprise domains (e.g., supply chain, logistics, finance), this creates unacceptable risk.

⸻

2.2 Business Requirement

The organization requires a system that:
	•	Preserves natural conversational interaction
	•	Enforces financial and operational governance
	•	Supports scalable and auditable execution
	•	Aligns with enterprise cloud and security standards

⸻

3. Proposed Solution Overview

The proposed solution is a multi-agent conversational architecture that separates:
	•	User interaction (conversational simplicity)
	•	Reasoning and orchestration
	•	Execution via deterministic tools
	•	Approval via isolated agents

This ensures that users experience simplicity, while the system enforces correctness.

⸻

4. Architectural Design

4.1 Agent-Based Decomposition

Agent	Role
Orchestrator Agent	Conversational entry point and decision coordinator
Inventory Agent	Inventory lookup and cost estimation
Logistics Agent	Shipping evaluation and execution
Finance Agent (Remote A2A)	Independent financial approval authority

Each agent has:
	•	A clearly defined responsibility
	•	Limited permissions
	•	No implicit execution authority outside its domain

⸻

4.2 Tool-Backed Execution (MCP Toolbox)

All real-world actions are executed through MCP tools, not free-form agent output.

Key characteristics:
	•	Declarative YAML definitions
	•	SQL-backed logic
	•	Parameterized inputs
	•	Auditable execution

This eliminates ambiguity and enforces deterministic behavior.

⸻

4.3 Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Governance

The Finance Agent is deployed as a remote service and accessed via Agent-to-Agent communication.

Purpose:
	•	Enforce approval boundaries
	•	Prevent bypass of financial checks
	•	Enable independent scaling and isolation
	•	Reflect real enterprise approval systems

⸻

5. Execution Flow
	1.	User interacts via conversational UI
	2.	Orchestrator Agent interprets intent
	3.	Inventory Agent retrieves item details and cost
	4.	Logistics Agent evaluates fulfillment options
	5.	Finance Agent (remote A2A) validates expenditure
	6.	Execution proceeds only upon approval
	7.	Consolidated response returned to user

This flow ensures governance before execution.

⸻

6. Conversational UI Strategy

6.1 Reference: Ticket Agent (Simple Domain)

In the ticket management use case:
	•	Single agent
	•	Low execution risk
	•	No financial approval
	•	Direct conversational execution

This allowed a pure conversational UI.

⸻

6.2 Supply Chain Domain (High-Risk Domain)

In the supply chain domain:
	•	Execution has real financial impact
	•	Approval is mandatory
	•	Multiple systems are involved

A pure conversational execution model is unsafe.

⸻

6.3 Proposed Pattern: Conversational Facade

Conversational UI
 └── Orchestrator Agent (Facade)
       ├── Inventory Agent
       ├── Logistics Agent
       └── Finance Agent (Remote)

Outcome:
	•	User experience remains conversational and simple
	•	Backend enforces governance, approvals, and execution order

⸻

7. Python Runtime & Environment Strategy

7.1 Current Runtime Constraints

Component	Python Version
Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)	Python 3.12
Agent Frameworks (ADK, MCP)	Python 3.10–3.11

Agent frameworks currently rely on dependencies not fully compatible with Python 3.12.

⸻

7.2 Runtime Isolation Model

System Python (3.12)
 └── Google Cloud SDK (managed)

Project Python (3.10/3.11)
 └── Agent runtime and tools

This separation:
	•	Prevents dependency conflicts
	•	Preserves gcloud stability
	•	Aligns with enterprise best practices

⸻

7.3 Supported Execution Options

Option	Usage
Virtual Environment	Local development
pyenv + venv	Controlled team environments
Docker	Production, Cloud Run, demos

This strategy ensures portability and stability.

⸻

8. UI vs Code Responsibility Matrix

Capability	UI	Code
Cloud project & APIs	✔	✔
IAM & networking	✔	✔
Conversational interface	✔	✔
Agent logic	✘	✔
Tool definitions	✘	✔
Orchestration	✘	✔
Governance enforcement	✘	✔

The UI supports configuration and interaction;
intelligence and control remain in code.

⸻

9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

Risk	Mitigation
Unapproved execution	Finance A2A agent
Dependency conflicts	Runtime isolation
Over-permissioned agents	Role-based agent design
Non-deterministic behavior	Tool-backed execution
Scalability issues	Distributed agent model


⸻

10. Benefits of the Proposed Approach
	•	Enterprise-grade governance
	•	Clear auditability
	•	Scalable and modular architecture
	•	Safe conversational experience
	•	Alignment with real-world enterprise workflows

⸻

11. Why This Is Not Over-Engineering

The complexity in this solution is:
	•	Intentional
	•	Structural
	•	Risk-driven

It reflects the realities of enterprise systems where:

Correctness is more important than convenience.

⸻

12. Recommendation

Proceed with this architecture as the reference implementation for:
	•	Enterprise conversational workflows
	•	High-impact operational domains
	•	Governed agent-based systems

This solution can be extended, simplified, or scaled depending on domain risk.

⸻

13. Conclusion

This proposal delivers a balanced, future-proof conversational system that combines:
	•	A simple user experience
	•	Strong governance
	•	Modern agent architecture
	•	Production-ready cloud practices

It represents a clear evolution from demo-level chatbots to enterprise-ready agent systems.
