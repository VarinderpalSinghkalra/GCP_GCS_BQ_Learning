"Create an issue management admin portal connecting to my Firestore database. The app should manage a collection called 'issues'. Create a primary view named 'Active Tickets' that filters records where the 'status' column is not 'Resolved'. In the detailed view for a ticket, allow support agents to edit the 'admin_response' and 'status' fields so they can reply to users. The app should be optimized for quick data entry and include a dashboard view showing tickets grouped by 'priority'."
